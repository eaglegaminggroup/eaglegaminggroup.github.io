question: What do I need to bring?
---
If you're playing board games, you only need to bring yourself! You can bring your own board game if you'd like, just email <a href="{{site.github.url}}/about.html">Professor Smith</a> and let him know. If you're playing D&amp;D, you need to bring your character information and a pen or pencil. You'll also need dice and a miniature. These can either be borrowed each Friday night or you can purchase your own from <a href="{{site.github.url}}/dnd-resources.html">several different places</a>.
