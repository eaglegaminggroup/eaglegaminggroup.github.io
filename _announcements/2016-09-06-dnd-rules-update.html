<p>Hello all,</p>
<p>I got a few emails today with some great questzions about the D&amp;D rules so I have updated the PDF and attached a new version. Additionally, I'll outline the changes below.</p>
<p><ol>
  <li>We will use the Variant: Custom Ability Scores rules for determining starting ability scores to ensure fairness to all our players. See rules document for more info.</li>
  <li>Dungeon Masters are free to use variant rules as they see fit (such as using a Battlemat) while they are running a game. For character creation or leveling up however, unless specifically stated, we will not sure any of the variant rules in the Player's Handbook or Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide. Let me or Camey know if there is a variant rule you would like to see us use and we will consider it.</li>
  <li>When you level up, you will use the formula for HP as listed in your class. In the example below, the formula would be 4 + Con modifier.</li>
</ol></p>
<p>#1 and #3 make up a more general rule as well: at Egg we won't be rolling dice as any part of character creation or leveling. This is to keep the game fair for all players and so that DMs can verify where stats and hit point values have come from (via math!).</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>Corbin</p>
