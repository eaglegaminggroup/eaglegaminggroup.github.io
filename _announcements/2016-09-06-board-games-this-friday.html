<p>As Corbin's note just announced, we're back with games again this Friday!</p>
<p>If you would like to play board games please email me. Let me know how many people will be with you, and if you have a preference for any games.</p>
<p>At this time I do not have anything planned - I'll pick out some games based on who is joining!</p>
<p>Prof. Smith</p>
<p>P.S. - Email me if you're coming! Hope to see you there!</p>
