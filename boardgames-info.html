  <p>Board games include a wide variety of modern and interesting board games. Professor Smith organizes the board game play and usually brings the games played. If you would like to help with board game planning or organization please contact Prof. Smith. He would appreciate help! Each week Prof. Smith will send an email to see how many people want to play board games that week. Everyone is welcome, but Prof. Smith needs a headcount to know how many kinds of games to bring. Watch your email for board game announcements each  week and let Prof. Smith know if you plan to join in and if you have games you will bring or want to play!</p>
