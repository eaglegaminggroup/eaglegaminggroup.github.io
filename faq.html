      A: If you're playing board games, you only need to bring yourself!

If you're playing D&amp;D, you need to bring your character information and a pen or pencil. You'll also need dice and a miniature. These can either be borrowed each Friday night or you can purchase your own from <a href="{{site.github.url}}/dnd-resources.html">several different places</a>.
